## Description
This is my JavaScript Framework Assignment @ [Noroff - School of technology and digital media](https://www.noroff.no/).
The website is an eCom store using Noroff's live API. On the StoreTown eCom store you can buy product in different category.

This project has:
- Homepage
- Individual product page
- Cart page
- Checkout success page

Some of the criteria:
- Fetch the list of products on the Homepage and store this as a state.
- Clicking on the Cart Icon component will take the user to the CheckoutPage page.
- The CheckoutPage must list all of the products in the cart, show a total at the bottom and a Checkout button.
- console.log the data from the form once validation requirements are met.
- Create a cart state. When the Add to cart button on the ProductPage is clicked, add the product to the cart.

## Built With

- [StyledComponents](https://styled-components.com/)
